Q. What Are Decentralized Applications (dApps)?
- Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer.
- DApps (also called "dapps") are outside the purview and control of a single authority.
- DApps—which are often built on the Ethereum platform—can be developed for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media.
# KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- Decentralized applications—also known as "dApps" or "dapps"—are digital applications that run on a blockchain network of computers instead of relying on a single computer.
- Because dApps are decentralized, they are free from the control and interference of a single authority.
- Benefits of dApps include the safeguarding of user privacy, the lack of censorship, and the flexibility of development.
- Drawbacks include the potential inability to scale, challenges in developing a user interface, and difficulties in making code modifications.

Q. What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?
- Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies.
- The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.
# Some of the key attractions of DeFi for many consumers are:
- It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services.
- You hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it in a bank.
- Anyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.
- You can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.
# KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- Decentralized finance, or DeFi, uses emerging technology to remove third parties in financial transactions.
- The components of DeFi are stablecoins, software, and hardware that enables the development of applications.
- The infrastructure for DeFi and its regulation are still under development and debate.

Q. How Does DeFi Work?
- Decentralized finance uses the blockchain technology that cryptocurrencies use.
- A blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger.
- Applications called dApps are used to handle transactions and run the blockchain.
- In the blockchain, transactions are recorded in blocks and then verified by other users.
- If these verifiers agree on a transaction, the block is closed and encrypted; another block is created that has information about the previous block within it.
- The blocks are "chained" together through the information in each proceeding block, giving it the name blockchain.
- Information in previous blocks cannot be changed without affecting the following blocks, so there is no way to alter a blockchain.
- This concept, along with other security protocols, provides the secure nature of a blockchain.
